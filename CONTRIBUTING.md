# 🤝 Contributing to the Mock File Method  
Welcome—and thank you for considering a contribution! This repository is a shared effort to scale clarity, reproducibility, and success through reusable AI prompt templates called **mock files**.

---

## 🧱 What Is a Mock File?

A **mock file** is a lightweight `.md` or `.txt` file that captures:
- ✅ The prompt text
- 🎯 The task or intent
- 📘 A sample output (optional)
- 🏷️ Tags and notes

Think of it as a “reusable AI interaction”—a proven pattern others can apply instantly.
