## 📌 What Is This?

This repository is a **living library of AI prompt mock files**—lightweight `.md` or `.txt` templates that capture:
- Prompt input
- Intended outcome
- Sample output
- Tags and usage notes

It’s designed to help individuals and teams **reuse successful AI interactions** without relying on long, fragile prompt strings.

## 🎯 Why Use Mock Files?

- ✅ Share prompt wins across teams  
- ✅ Reproduce results with clarity  
- ✅ Build a personal or organizational prompt library  
- ✅ Replace Notepad chaos with structured, versioned artifacts

README.md           → This file  
```

## 🧱 How to Use a Mock File

1. Open any `.md` file in `/templates/`  
2. Copy the full block into your AI tool (e.g., Copilot, ChatGPT)  
3. Add a line like:  
   > “Use this mock file to replicate the intended behavior.”  
4. Watch the AI regenerate the result with consistency
